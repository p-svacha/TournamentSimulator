-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Aoe2 Discipline (v2):

Game itself works the same way as football.
It uses different skills (11-13).
And each match takes place on a particular map (MapDef).
Some skills are used in every match (5):
	- Gaming
	- Multitasking
	- Adaptility
	- Resource Management
	- Strategic Planning
Some skills are used based on match state (3):
	- Score-Mentality [winning / even / losing] in match
	- Endurance-Mentality [early / mid / late] in match 
	- Clutch-Mentality [low / neutral / high] pressure (based on match position in tournament, stays the same within match)
Some skills are used based on map (3-5):
	- Map knowledge skill [1 per map]
	- Skill for every tag the map has
If end result after this is a tie, the default tiebreaker is used to decide (total match score).

Change to Skills:
	Each player will now have 3 values per skill
	SkillVaulue, SkillInconsistency, SkillFailChance
	SkillInconsistency and SkillFailChance replace the general inconcistency and fail chance

Existing Skill "Mentality" will be renamed to "Adaptility" and be used in both disciplines

Map Tags:
- Open (7)
- Closed (4)
- Land (6)
- Water (2)
- Hybrid (3)
- Iconic (5)
- Chokepoint (2)
- Nomad (2)
- Centralized (2)
- Elevation (2)


Maps:

Arabia:			Open, Land, Iconic
Black Forest:		Closed, Land, Chokepoint, Iconic
Arena:			Closed, Land, Iconic
Nomad:			Open, Hybrid, Nomad, Iconic
Islands:		Closed, Water, Iconic
Four Lakes:		Open, Hybrid
Gold Rush:		Open, Centralized, Land, Elevation
Migration:		Closed, Water, Centralized
Highland:		Open, Hybrid, Chokepoint
Acropolis:		Open, Land, Elevation
African Clearing:	Open, Land, Nomad

Pick & Ban:
Players ban maps until [n+2] in a best of n are left.
	In a bo5 with 11 maps, 4 (2 each) would be banned - so 5+2=7 are left
Then players pick n-1 maps (2 each in a bo5) - 3 are left
Last map (that is played first in the match) is picked at random from the remaining 3.
Bans are calculated by combining own and opponent skill on each map and then banning those where the gap in favor of opponent is the biggest.
