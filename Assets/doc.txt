------------------------------- Before season 5 ------------------------------------------
world cup
	> new system: groups into ko
	> groups need to be a completely new datastructure with own advancement rules
	> groups are round robin
	> allow draws in groups, not in ko (a draw is simply when both teams have the same amount of points)
		> if draw is not allowed, take TeamMatch.GetTotalTeamScore() as tiebreaker
		> add some kind of visual cue that shows if a draw is a draw or someone got the tiebreaker like (2 : 2*) *= won tiebreaker by total team score
	> take 16 best teams by averegae player elo and randomly seed them
	> new overview page for that tournament
	> mode is team 1v1
	> each year different amount of players
	> first world cup is 2 players per team, then 3, then 2 or 4 (depending if enough teams with 4)
